The images and app name are NOT included in the MIT license, so replace those with your own if forking this app.

A tutorial for understanding the Siri parts of this app was published by [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/sirikit-intents-app-guide/).

This branch contains what you need to add support for Siri Shortcuts, as explained in this [Smashing article I wrote about WWDC 2018](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/06/wwdc-2018-diary-ios-developer/)
